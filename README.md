# Personal Book Management System

A web application that allows users to manage their offline book collections in an online database. Users can add books to their collections by entering the ISBN, and the system looks up the book's details via the OpenLibrary API and stores them in the database. The system binds the user to the book. The user can create a forum for the book to find other readers and have conversations with them.
